Phase 0
- clean and merge datasets
- outcome variable = rent growth acceleration
- create affordability measures (rent to income, income)
- exploratory plots
- validate acceleration vs baseline growth
    - slope and r2

Phase 1: Variable Justification + setup
prove variables mean what i say they mean

for each variable, explain how it is calculated and why it is a proxy for housing affordability/pressure

Phase 2: Empirical Analysis
- baseline multivariate regression
- introduce remote work pressure with proxy
- heterogeneity analysis -- where is this effect strongest?

Phase 3: Interpretation 
explain why this is happening 
- counterfactual -- what would have happened without these inflows

Phase 4: Policy Simulation

Phase 5: Write up
